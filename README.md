# Consumer's Buying Behavior

**Description:**
The dataset contains information on consumer buying behavior, specifically focusing on age, estimated salary, and purchase decisions in response to advertising. It consists of 400 observations with three main columns: Age, Estimated Salary, and Purchased. The 'Age' column represents the age of the individuals, the 'Estimated Salary' column represents their estimated salary, and the 'Purchased' column indicates whether they made a purchase (1) or not (0) in response to the advertisement. This dataset is suitable for binary classification tasks, where the objective might be to predict whether an individual will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques can be applied to understand patterns, distributions, and correlations within the dataset before building predictive models.
